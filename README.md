A short introduction to Julia
=============================

This repository collects slides, exercises and other supporting material used in
Julia language introduction courses that I deliver on-demand.

The material in this course covers:

* the basics of Julia programming, up to the point of being able to do simple loops,
  file I/O, and basic data structure manipulation (parts 01 through 05);
* basics of array manipulation and plotting (part 07);
* table manipulation with DataFrame.jl (part 08).

Basic computer programming knowledge (e.g., what is a variable, what is a loop)
is assumed and not covered in the material: students should already be familiar
with scripting languages (e.g. Python, MATLAB) and have already written some
computer programs.


How to use the material
-----------------------

The Jupyter notebooks in files `*.EX.ipynb` (in folder `exercises/`) contain
exercises to be solved during the course. A copy of the notebooks with complete
solutions, is available in the `solutions/` subdirectory. A PDF slide deck
introduces and completements the first exercise notebook; for parts 7 and 8,
commentary and links are directly embedded in the notebook and there is no
separate slide deck.


Where has this been used?
-------------------------

So far, the material here has been used:

* for the ScITS training [Julia for programmers][x1]
  at the University of Bern in September 2019.
